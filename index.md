Hi! I'm Charlie Armentrout.  

I'm a software engineer from North Carolina and I've been writing code for about eleven years now. Most of that has been in Python, but I've recently fallen in love with functional programming and I've been writing Scala for the last two years and having a blast! 

Most of my carrer has been spent writing back-end business logic for various services, from remote network test execution to financial ledger systems. I'm definitely most comfortable in that space, but I've also picked up the skills necessary to make that fit into a larger system, including some "ops"-y stuff around targeting docker and k8s, running pieces of the system serverless on AWS, and even some dabbling in the front-end occasionally.

My entire life has been spent voraciously learning new things, and that's not changing any time soon, so feel free to throw something new my way too. I'll pick it up in no time and add it to the toolbox. 

I also enjoy teaching and mentoring junior engineers, or just anyone that wants to learn something I know a lot about! My time as a team lead was especially enjoyed and I hope to return to leadership again one day soon.
